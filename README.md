# hello-world
This is my inaugural exercise of Hello World in GitHub
I am a kind of program manager acting right now as an experimental developer, searching for options to take control of versions and centralizing code. The best of all is that I get paid for it!...Well, I must say this is a good part, but the best of all is that I am learning and getting good things for my requester.
